# Restore Lost Functionality

This plugin allows you to add or remove features to restore previous WordPress functionality. Where this function change requires more than a few lines of code, and an existing plugin exists to do this, a link will be provided so that this plugin can be installed instead and it's installation status will be shown on this screen.

Features are often removed simply due to streamlining the UI but sometimes there can be a more serious reason for the change. Please ensure you read all the details in this README before proceeding.
