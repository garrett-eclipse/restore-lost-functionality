# Restore Lost Functionality

This plugin allows you to add or remove features to restore previous WordPress functionality. Where this function change requires more than a few lines of code, and an existing plugin exists to do this, a link will be provided so that this plugin can be installed instead and it's installation status will be shown on this screen.

Features are often removed simply due to streamlining the UI but sometimes there can be a more serious reason for the change. Please ensure you read all the details in this README before proceeding.

The following features are available for adding/removing...

* Restore the OpenSans font in Admin (changed in WordPress 4.6)
* Change the behavior of automatic updates (adds in WordPress 3.7)
* Move comment text field to the bottom (removed in WordPress 4.4)

* Add Links Manager to the administration menu (removed in WordPress 3.5)
* Once Links Manager is back you can also add the "Link This" bookmarketlet (removed in WordPress 2.5)
* Option to display Shortlink in admin toolbar (removed in WordPress 3.3)
* Switch back to a single column dashboard (changed in WordPress 3.8)
* Remove SRCSET parameter from images (added in WordPress 4.4)
